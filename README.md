# Movies ETL

The purpose of this project is to create an automated pipeline to take in new data, perform transformations, and loads the data into existing tables in pgAdmin. Data is pulled from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and MovieLens. These three data sources are transformed using Jupyter Notebook and loaded into a PostgreSQL database.
